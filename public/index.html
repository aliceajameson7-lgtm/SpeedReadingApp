       If you struggle with comphrehension and speed try the "Chunking" method.
       Congregate words into phrases rather then reading individual words. This
       Method takes pratice, but can be beneficiary when consuming text.
    </p>
    <p>
        Example: "Betty likes to walk, and smell roses."
        Splite this sentence into 2 phrases and read them each at once.
                 "(Betty likes to walk), (and smell roses.)"
    </p>
    <p>
        You can also utilize the "Tracer" method by tracing your finger (Or any other object) along the screen.
        Doing this helps textual precision, and alleviates the process of reading long texts.

    <button id="stopQuickReadBtn">Stop</button> <p id="this">Speed(milliseconds)</p> <input id="speed" type="number">

        This exersize assists compution speed, and will proggress your overall speed. Set the value above to your
        prefered speed (Sec x 1000 = Ms).
